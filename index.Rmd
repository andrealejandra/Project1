## Health Indicators in Texas Counties

### Andrea Virgen AAV782

#### Introduction 

I'm interested to see how and if there are correlations between obesity rates, diabetes, and rates of sufficient physical activity. I would infer that counties with the highest rates of obesity and diabetes would have lower life expectancy, but it remains to be seen if higher rates of sufficient exercise compensates for these rates. The first dataset(phys) shows percentage prevalence of each location's population that achieves a sufficient amount of physical activity - specificity of measurement or sample size is unknown. The second dataset(obesity) shows percentage prevalence of obesity(criteria not given), normalized by age. The third dataset(diabetes) houses the percentage of people who reported a formal diagnosis or elevated levels of FPG/A1C, standardized by age. The final dataset(life) houses life expectancies by county.

```{R}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

phys <- read_excel("IHME_county_data_LifeExpectancy_Obesity_PhysicalActivity_TEXAS.xls", 
    sheet = "Physical Activity")

obesity <- read_excel("IHME_county_data_LifeExpectancy_Obesity_PhysicalActivity_TEXAS.xls", 
    sheet = "Obesity")

diabetes <- read_excel("IHME_county_data_Diabetes_TEXAS.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Total")

life <- read_excel("IHME_county_data_LifeExpectancy_Obesity_PhysicalActivity_TEXAS.xls", 
    sheet = "Life Expectancy")

```

#### Tidying: Reshaping

Because these datasets have one numeric variable each, I am reshaping them to be combined on the basis of Location, Sex, and Year. The life expectancy(life) dataset was collected from years that do not overlap with the data from the other three datasets, so I will be taking the average from the data available for a later comparison with the other variables.

```{R}

life %>%
  select(-14:15) %>%
  pivot_longer(-1, names_to="desc", values_to="Life Expectancy") %>%
  rename("Location" = "State/County") %>%
  separate(desc, into = c("desc2", "Year"), sep=", ") %>%
  separate(desc2, into=c("Sex", NA)) %>%
  filter(Sex!="Difference") %>%
  group_by(Location, Sex) %>%
  transmute("Avg Life Expectancy"= sum(`Life Expectancy`)/n()) %>%
  distinct() -> life

phys %>%
  select(1:7)%>%
  pivot_longer(c(2:7), names_to = "desc", values_to= "Percent Active") %>%
  separate(desc, into=c("desc2", "year"), sep=", ") %>%
  separate(desc2, into =c("Sex",NA,NA,NA,NA)) %>%
  separate(year, into="Year") %>%
  rename(Location = "State/County") -> phys

obesity %>%
  select(1:7) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(2:7), names_to = "desc", values_to= "Percent Obese") %>%
  separate(desc, into =c("desc2", "Year"), sep=", ") %>%
  separate(desc2, into=c("Sex", NA, NA)) %>%
  separate(Year, into="Year") %>%
  rename(Location = "State/County") -> obesity


diabetes %>%
  pivot_longer(3:47, names_to = "desc", values_to= "Percent Diabetic") %>%
  separate(desc, into = c(NA, "Year", "Sex")) %>%
  separate(Sex, into = c("Sex", NA), sep="s") %>%
  select(c(1, 3:5)) %>%
  filter(Sex!="Both") %>%
  filter(Year==c("2001", "2009", "2011")) %>%
  separate(Location, into=c("Location", NA)) -> diabetes
  
```

    
#### Joining/Merging

```{R}
glimpse(diabetes)
glimpse(obesity)
full_join(obesity, diabetes, by=c("Year", "Sex", "Location")) 
# left_join(phys, life, by=c("Location", "Sex")) %>% 
#   left_join(inner, by=c("Location", "Year", "Sex"))

  

```

The obesity and diabetes datasets are the most similar..
