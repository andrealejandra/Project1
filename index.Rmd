## Mortality in the US

### Andrea Virgen AAV782

#### Introduction 

My two datasets are Covid-19-centric. Dataset 1 (covid) compares the incidence of pneumonia, Covid-19, influenza and their proportion of the total deaths per age group and race/Hispanic origin. Dataset 2 (all_causes) examines the incidence of different diseases compared to Covid-19 by age-group and region. 

```{R}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

covid <- read_csv("Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Race_and_Hispanic_Origin__and_Age.csv")
all_causes <- read_csv("AH_Monthly_Provisional_Counts_of_Deaths_by_Age_Group_and_HHS_region_for_Select_Causes_of_Death__2019-2021.csv")

```

#### Tidying: Reshaping

If your datasets are tidy already, demonstrate that you can reshape data with pivot wider/longer here (e.g., untidy and then retidy). Alternatively, it may be easier to wait until the wrangling section so you can reshape your summary statistics. Note here if you are going to do this.

```{R}
glimpse(covid)
glimpse(all_causes)
```
